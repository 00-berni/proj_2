# FIELD RESTORATION

## <a id='toc1_1_'></a>[The Task](#toc0_)
The task is to simulate the image restoration of a star sample. Three steps are required:

1. Generate the sample from a Salpeter's IMF
2. Add the background noise, the seeing effect and the noise of the detector
3. Restore the sample from the field

This procedure is implemented by the modules in the `skysimulation` directory, that is the python package.
